## Machine Actionable Metadata Models
One of the most common format to exchange data over the web in the **JavaScript Object notation** (**JSON**). It's a popular open-standard
that can be used to represent data and metadata instances as well as the constrains describing an object (also called **schema**).
<br/> Schemas are built using the **JSON-Schema** standard which informs about the syntactic constrains of an object: properties name, 
description, values allowed, cardinality, references to other schemas, ect ....
<br/>They are **highly interconnected** and can even contain circularity. This allows to represent very complex structures (called networks in this documentation), which, however, may become
hardly human readable. To emphasise this phenomena, semantic constrains for machine readability that should also be taken into consideration create an even more complex specification.

#### Separating syntactic and semantic layers:
![alt text](assets/separation_of_concerns.png "Separation of semantic and syntactic concerns")

In order to cope with the semantic and syntactic concerns, schemas were separated using context files inspired by the **JSON-LD** specification. Each schema is bound to a set of context 
files (through mapping files) that deliver the ontology tags describing the object properties.
<br/> The purpose of this repository is to provide a python 3 toolkit that help users create, compare, merge and export these schemas and their associated context files in order to 
increase the existing pool of **machine** and **human readable models** that represent **syntactic** and **semantic constrains of metadata**.
<br/> This is very important, especially in the context of data **Findability**, **Accessibility**, **Integrability** and **Reusablity** ([FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)) 
where a lot of representations are still too verbose and lack machine readable formats. 


#### Inputs
The input schema networks used to create the toolkit can be found as follow:
- Minimum Information About Cell Assays: **[MIACA](https://github.com/FAIRsharing/mircat/tree/master/miaca)** 
- Minimum Information About Cell Migration Experiments: **[MIACME](https://github.com/FAIRsharing/mircat/tree/master/miacme)**
- Data Tag Suite: **DATS** [schemas](https://github.com/datatagsuite/schema) and [context](https://github.com/datatagsuite/context)
- Minimum Information About Flow Cytometry Experiments: **[MiFlowCyt](https://github.com/FAIRsharing/mircat/tree/master/miflowcyt)**


#### Navigation

1) [Setting up](#setting-up)
1) [Explore existing schemas in the browser](#exploring-an-existing-set-of-schemas) (requires the jsonschema documenter)
2) Compare schemas in the browser (requires the compare-and-view tool)
3) Merge schemas
4) Create new context files or extend existing ones
5) Export schemas in the CEDAR application
6) Import MiFlowCyt instances (dataset) as JSON-LD and validate them against the proper schema set (requires an API key)
7) Identify circularity in existing set of schemas (using yet another python library)


## Setting Up:

First, you will need a virtual environment, import the code and install dependencies:
```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
git clone https://github.com/FAIRsharing/jsonldschema.git
cd jsonldschema
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you plan on using either the CEDAR exporter or the MiFlowCyt importer, you will need to provide your API keys through 
a configuration file and, optionally run the integration tests.
- make a copy of the ```/tests/test_config.json.sample``` file and open the copy:

```bash
cp /tests/test_config.json.sample /tests/test_config.json
```

You will need to provide:
- your staging and production CEDAR API keys (include the key string in the corresponding attribute)
- an existing and valid CEDAR folder ID on which you can read/write content on the production server
- an existing and valid CEDAR template ID on which you can read/write content on the production server
- a valid user ID which will become the author of created content (UUID on your CEDAR user profile page, https://cedar.metadatacenter.org/profile)
- a valid [Flow Repository](https://flowrepository.org/) API key.

Integration tests are located under ```/tests/integration```. They rely on API calls and are excluded from the continuous integration builds.


## Exploring an existing set of schemas:

### Use-cases
Whether you need to create your own set of interconnected schemas or explore existing ones, you will need to visualize them.
<br/> The [JSON-Schema Documenter](https://github.com/FAIRsharing/JSONschema-documenter) is a javascript client-side application that 
allows users to explore these networks directly in their browser by either downloading the application locally or using the online service.

Exploring networks with the JSON-Schema documenter allows you to identify reusable components (simple objects such as Person and Organization have already been described) and to verify that:
- relationships between schemas and syntactic constrains are represented as expected
- each field is correctly tagged with a semantic label (e.g.: ```name``` is labelled with ```sdo:name```)


### Usage
If your schemas are living remotely and are accessible through a URL, you can use the [online tool](https://fairsharing.github.io/JSONschema-documenter/) directly by providing your main 
schema URL as a parameter to the tool URL. To do that, add ```?schema_url=yourURL``` at the end of the tool.
<br/> For instance, to view the MIACA network the URL would be ```https://fairsharing.github.io/JSONschema-documenter?schema_url=https://w3id.org/mircat/miacme/schema/miacme_schema.json```

If you also want to add the semantic constrains pulled from the associated context files, you will have to provide a mapping file containing these references that can be generated 
for you using the ```schema2context.generate_context_mapping()``` class method (see [documentation](https://jsonldschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/utils/schemaUtilities.html#schema2context.generate_context_mapping)). 
You can then upload that mapping file (on github for instance) and provide its URL  as another parameter to the documenter. 
<br/> For MIACA, we would have the following ```https://fairsharing.github.io/JSONschema-documenter/?schema_url=https://w3id.org/mircat/miacme/schema/miacme_schema.json&context_mapping_url=https://w3id.org/mircat/miacme/schema_context_mapping.json```.

If the schemas are living locally only (which is usually the case during development), you can clone the JSON-Schema documenter repository and, optionally,
put it under a web server (such as Apache, Nginx, ...). It will then behave the same way the online service does but can resolve local networks.
<br/>For instance, if the application is deserved through port 8000, your url would be:
 ```localhost:8000/JSONschema-documenter?schema_url=path/to/main/schema.json&context_mapping_url=path/to/context/mapping/file.json```
<br/> We recommend using the ```schemas/``` directory at the root of the application for that purpose.

## Compare schemas

### Use-cases
Comparing schemas can be particularly useful if you intend on creating **metadata that comply with several models** or to **identify
overlaps with existing networks** when creating/extending set of schemas.
<br/> The key point to understand before comparing schemas or networks is that the comparisons are solely based on ontology labels found
in context files. This means that will be ignored:
1) Fields and objects that don't have a semantic values
2) Syntactic constrains (could be extended) 

Note: to verify if all fields are correctly tagged with an ontology term, see above [Exploring an existing set of schemas](#exploring-an-existing-set-of-schemas).
<br/>

The python tool will assist you into running the comparison process which will generate an output file containing the comparison results. However, 
to visualize the results, you will need to use a second javascript application, the [compare-and-view](https://github.com/FAIRsharing/JSONschema-compare-and-view) tool.
<br/> A particularity of this tool is that it relies on the Ontology Lookup Service ([OLS](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/index)) API to find the corresponding human readable terms. For instance
```NCBITaxon_9606``` is also shown as ```homo sapien``` when displaying a planned process source in the context of MIACA and MIACME (see figure [below](#screenshots-of-the-miaca-network-loaded-in-the-jsonschema-online-documenter)).


### Usage
In order to run a comparison between two networks you will have to use the ```FullDiffGenerator``` or  ```FullSemDiff```classes (see [documentation](https://jsonldschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/semDiff/semDiffIndex.html))
based on your use case. Optionally, you can also run a schema comparison with the ```EntityCoverage``` class 
(see [documentation](https://jsonldschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/semDiff/semanticComparator.html))
if you are working on a specific schema and don't want to resolve the full networks.
<br> The comparison process is not very intensive but may require to resolve all schemas in the two given networks. This process 
can be long depending on the number and size of the schemas and the properties of the server delivering them.

<br/> These three class will generate a variable containing all overlapping fields and/or schemas, which is not very useful as such.
